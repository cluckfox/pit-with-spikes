Pit with Spikes
===============

_A "Game Engine"_

This product is based directly on the 
[SNROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/snrom-template) by 
[Damian Yerric](https://github.com/pinobatch) and Contributors. My deepest
gratitude goes to them and all homebrew developers who came before me.

This is not quite a real game, but is designed & documented to be forked and
finished to create one.

Music & Sound
=============

Demo music is "Tutorial Song" from the
[FamiStudio](https://github.com/BleuBleu/FamiStudio) tracker software. It is
rendered using the FamiStudio sound engine from the same repository.
